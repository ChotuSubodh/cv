  <h1>Details</h1>
  <p>A world line is a special type of curve in spacetime.</p>
  <p>Below an equivalent definition will be explained</p>
  <p> A world line is a time-like curve in spacetime.</p>
  <h2>More about</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Each point of a world line is an event that can be <br> labeled with the time and the spatial position <br> of the object at that time.</li>
    <li>What is your world line? <br>Thus in general usage, a world line is <strong> the sequential path of <br>personal human events that marks the history of a <br>person</strong> — perhaps starting at the time <br> and place of one's birth until
      one's death.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Points</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Instead of the world lines existing as an infinite mass</li>
    <li>They instead naturally group together in bundles</li>
    <li>like strands of rope heading to the future</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Points heighted</h3>
  <ol type="i">
    <li>Within these bundles, called “attractor fields</li>
    <li> the world lines branch out in infinite possibilities but <br>always converge again at major moments in history.</li>
  </ol>
